I am Yuyao Wang (王宇峣), a $\left\lceil\frac{(now() - 2024/09/16).to\text{_}day()}{year.day}\right\rceil=1$st year Ph.D. student at the [Computer Systems Lab](https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/) of [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), advised by Prof. [Ratul Mahajan](https://ratul.org) and [Arvind Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind). My research interest broadly lies in topics related to the *correctness*, *programmability* and *performance* of computer systems. 

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en). I was also fortunate to work with Prof. [Lingming Zhang](https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/) at UIUC.

<!-- I am Yuyao Wang (王宇峣), a senior student in Computer Science (Elite Class) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en). 

I have been attached to programming and algorithm design since middle school and aspire to bring elegant solutions for tackling *real-world* problems. -->
