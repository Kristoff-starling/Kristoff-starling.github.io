I am Yuyao Wang (王宇峣), a senior student in Computer Science (Elite Class) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en). My research interest lies in topics related to the *correctness*, *programmability* and *performance* of computer systems. 

I have been attached to programming and algorithm design since middle school and aspire to bring elegant solutions for tackling *real-world* problems.
